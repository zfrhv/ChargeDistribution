# Surface Charge Distribution Simulator

This simulation demonstrates how charge distributes on the surface of a conductor.  

There are 3 options:
- charge spread on a 2d surface
- charge spread on a 3d shape
- current blah blah

The 2d charges/electrons distribution was made with help of [Simon Berens](https://github.com/SimonBerens/ChargeDistribution).
