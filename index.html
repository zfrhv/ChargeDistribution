<!-- TODO add control bar from right side (cuz left side is for the navbar) -->
<!-- in the control bar make so for each shape i could choose if it connected and then input the volrage, or disconnected and input the charge on the conductor -->
<!-- available shapes: cube, sphere, circle, square, line (small tube) -->

<!-- ok so 3 simulators: -->
<!-- 2d shapes charge distribution but in a 3d space (you can put multiple places) -->
    <!-- input parameters: is the shape grounded/connected to wire, if so whats the voltage, if not then whats the charge -->
    <!-- control over the orientation and the position of the shape -->
    <!-- output: the electric field lines and potential levels lines -->
    <!-- available shapes: circle (just circle + dot for small r), rectangle (square + line for small h) -->
<!-- 3d shapes charge distribution -->
    <!-- input parameters: is the shape grounded/connected to wire, if so whats the voltage, if not then whats the charge -->
    <!-- control over the orientation and the position of the shape -->
    <!-- output: the electric field lines and potential levels lines -->
    <!-- available shapes: sphere, rectengular (cube + plates or rods for small h),  -->
<!-- wire simulator -->
    <!-- the charge distribution over a circular wire -->
    <!-- the input is the potential across the wire? -->
    <!-- output is the potential voltage across the wire? -->
    <!-- need it to know the charge distribution for linear potential in a circular wire -->
    <!-- then from that charge distribution i need to check for the force with another conductive coil -->
    <!-- and then conductive coil + also current via different voltages -->


<!-- post it both on github pages and firebase for higher googling chances -->
